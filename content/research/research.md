<div class="title"><h3><strong>Automated knowledge extraction from maintenance reports and popular texts on nature conservation</strong></h3></div>
<div class="content">
  <img src="arne.png" style="height: 100px; width:100px;">
  <div class="text">
	<p>Our research focuses on extracting structured knowledge from unstructured natural language texts. 
These texts range from industrial maintenance reports to publications on nature conservation. 
Various techniques are explored such as knowledge graph construction, failure code prediction, topic clustering and query systems.</p>

<div class="title"><h3><strong>Mathematical optimization of tablet formulations</strong></h3></div>
<div class="content">
  <img src="manuel.png" style="height: 100px; width:100px;">
  <div class="text">
	<p>During development of new drug products, both the formulation and production process need to be optimized to achieve robust performance and deliver a final drug product that meets a series of critical quality attributes (CQAs). 
Formulation development is in many cases based on the formulatorâ€™s experience by means of trial-and-error which can potentially lead to increased experimental workload which induces additional costs and delayed time-to-market. 
This project aims to implement machine learning techniques into the drug development process to guide the experimentation during drug development which will can lead to a reduction of the number of experiments that is needed to obtain a successful final drug product.</p>

<div class="title"><h3><strong>Analytical Quality-by-Design and hybrid modelling - Enabling technologies for ATMP manufacturing 4.0</strong></h3></div>
<div class="content">
  <img src="evan.png" style="height: 100px; width:100px;">
  <div class="text">
	<p>Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) will revolutionize 21st century medicine, as evidenced by several major scientific and clinical breakthroughs in the past decade. 
By using cells as therapeutic agents, one can treat or cure an unprecedented variety of diseases or defects, even as a personalized therapy. 
However, the complexity of living cell products makes the ATMP field equally challenging as it is promising. 
Of the 10 ATMPs approved by EMA from 2009-2018, only 6 are currently still on the market, which is a waste of public resources as well as potentially life-changing therapies. 
At present, ATMPs are typically not effective enough, as well as too expensive. 
Personalized, closed and automated processes (i.e. industry 4.0) are often cited as a key facilitators towards the mitigation of these challenges. 
A prerequisite for these processes, as corroborated in the Process Analytical Technology (PAT) initiative and statement by the FDA, is that the Critical Quality Attributes of the product can be evaluated cost-effectively, non-invasively, automatically, and in real-time. 
However, there are no off-the-shelf sensor options for ATMPs that meet these criteria. 
More advanced analytical methods such as Raman spectroscopy, impedance spectroscopy and soft sensing have been cited as promising monitoring methods for cell-based processing for over a decade. 
There are two main challenges to the use of these methods. 
In this project, we would like to address these challenges. Additionally, we will explore resource-efficient process optimization strategies.</p>

<div class="content">
  <img src="maarten.png" style="height: 100px; width:100px;">
  <div class="text">
	<p>Previous research clearly showed the potential of video analysis and machine learning to study dairy cow behaviour. 
However, no long term study with the aim of collecting and analysing behavioural data of a commercial sized herd was yet executed. 
Therefore, we aim to develop a video analysis based monitoring system to study the behaviour dairy cows in an automated way. 
With this computer vision based pipeline, we will carry out a profound study of the behaviour of dairy cows in commercial herds, both in indoor and grazing conditions.</p>

<div class="title"><h3><strong>Surrogate modeling of CFD simulation of bioprocesses using machine learning</strong></h3></div>
<div class="content">
  <img src="umut.png" style="height: 100px; width:100px;">
  <div class="text">
	<p>Mathematical modeling of pharmaceutical processes helps scientist to design efficient and high quality production processes. 
	Physics-based models are typically time consuming to perform, therefore hybrid approaches with the data-driven models holds a great potential to increase the use of such models. 
	In our research, we focus on developing surrogate models for the CFD simulations of bioprocesses using machine learning.</p>

<div class="title"><h3><strong>Algorithmic automated behavior detection of caged-animals using computer vision</strong></h3></div>
<div class="content">
  <img src="nusret.png" style="height: 100px; width:100px;">
  <div class="text">
	<p>The study of animal behavior allow scientiests to percieve the individual and social patterns. Although it is a rapidly growing area of study, the traditional approaches 
	   still predominate from collection of behavioral data to analysis of it. By creating automated pipelines and developing validation strategies for species under the focus,
	   we aim to develop methodologies for characterisation of caged-animal behaviors. Application of state-of-art computer vision algorithms and integrating prior knowledge about the
	   environmental knowledge, we build accurate and robust techniques from collection of data to knowledge extraction from it.</p>
