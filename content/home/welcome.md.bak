<p>The <strong>Biovism</strong> lab focuses on the automated extraction of information from visual and multi-modal sensors and its embedding in computational models, with applications in the life sciences. Biovism is part of the research unit on Knowledge-based Systems of the Faculty of Bioscience engineering at Ghent University.
Researchers at the lab develop and new methodologies in the fields of computer vision, multi-modal data analysis and applied mathematics that allow to extract and fuse information from heterogeneous and unstructured data sources, to improve the performance of computational models in the animal, pharmaceutical and environmental sciences. </p>
